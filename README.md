# Thesis-Matlab
This Repo was written for my Thesis from Ryerson University in Toronto for my MaSC's of Chemical Engineering.
The project was to analysis the fluid dynamics of a vertical bioreactor for the biological removal of nutrients in wastewater. 
All scripts were written in `Matlab`.
This Repo also includes come `AutCAD` files which were also part of my thesis.

The experiment included the introduction of a tracer injected into a bioreactor. 
By recording the conductivity of the tracer going through the reactor, data was collected to create a model of the fluid dynamics.
